## Architecture

### Agent Implementation

The platform is built on the `AIAgent` interface which extends the `Actor` base
class, providing:

- Persistent state handling through `ActorState`
- Comprehensive memory management
- Both synchronous and streaming operations
- Configurable agent identity and instruction sets

### Communication

Agents support multiple communication modes:

- Synchronous operations via direct `generate()` calls
- Asynchronous streaming for real-time interactions
- Tool-based interactions through an extensible system
- Multi-channel integration capabilities

## Security & Configuration

### Authentication

- User email tracking
- Thread ID management
- API key management
- Environment-based configuration

### Environment Setup

- Cloudflare integration
- Account-level settings
- Gateway management

## Getting Started

1. Install the package:

```bash
npm install @deco/agents
```

2. Configure your environment variables:

```env
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
LIBSQL_URL=your_libsql_url
AI_PROVIDER_API_KEYS=your_api_keys
```

3. Initialize an agent:

```typescript
import { AIAgent } from "@deco/agents";

const agent = new AIAgent({
  name: "MyAgent",
  model: "claude-3-sonnet",
  instructions: "Your agent instructions here",
});
```
