# Deco.AI: Enterprise AI Agent Platform

## Technical Architecture Overview

A sophisticated Multi-AI Agent platform leveraging Cloudflare's infrastructure
with support for multiple AI providers including Anthropic, OpenAI, Google,
Mistral, Deepseek, Perplexity, and XAI.

## Core Technical Components

### 1. AI Agent Implementation

- **Base Interface**: Implements `AIAgent` extending `Actor`
- **State Management**: Persistent state handling through `ActorState`
- **Memory System**:
  - LibSQL Vector storage for embeddings
  - File System-based storage for persistent data
  - Structured memory management via `@mastra/memory`

### 2. Model Support

Extensive support for state-of-the-art models:

- **Anthropic**: Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4, O1 series
- **Google**: Gemini 2.0/1.5 series
- **Mistral**: Pixtral and Mistral variants
- **Others**: Deepseek, Perplexity Sonar, XAI Grok-2

### 3. Integration Architecture

- **MCP (Multi-Cloud Platform) Server System**:
  - Dynamic server connection management
  - Configurable filters for tool inclusion/exclusion
  - Header-based authentication
  - URL-based routing

### 4. Communication Interfaces

Each agent supports:

- **Synchronous Operations**: Direct generate() calls
- **Asynchronous Streaming**: Stream-based communication
- **Tool-based Interactions**: Extensible tool system
- **Multi-channel Integration**:
  - Email Systems
  - Messaging Platforms (WhatsApp, Slack, Discord)
  - Enterprise Systems (Microsoft Teams)
  - Automated Tasks (CRON)

### 5. Agent Capabilities

- **Configuration Management**:
  - Name and identity management
  - Instruction sets
  - Model selection
  - MCP server connections
- **Tool System**:
  - Dynamic tool registration
  - Schema-validated inputs/outputs
  - Native and MCP-provided tools
- **Memory & State**:
  - Persistent storage
  - Vector-based retrieval
  - Context-aware responses

### 6. Security & Authentication

- **Request-level Authentication**:
  - User email tracking
  - Thread ID management
  - API key management
- **Environment Configuration**:
  - Cloudflare integration
  - Account-level settings
  - Gateway management

### 7. Development Features

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Schema Validation**: Zod-based schema validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
- **Async Support**: Promise-based operations
- **Stream Processing**: AsyncIterator implementation

## Implementation Benefits

- **Enterprise-Ready**: Production-grade implementation
- **Scalable Architecture**: Cloudflare-backed infrastructure
- **Flexible Integration**: Multiple communication channels
- **Secure Operations**: Built-in authentication and authorization
- **Extensible Design**: Plugin-based tool system
- **State Management**: Persistent and ephemeral state handling

## Technical Requirements

- Cloudflare Workers environment
- LibSQL database for vector storage
- File system access for persistent storage
- API keys for various AI providers
- Network access for MCP server connections

## Development Considerations

- Implements actor model for concurrent operations
- Uses modern TypeScript features
- Supports both synchronous and streaming operations
- Provides comprehensive tool management system
- Includes built-in memory and state management
